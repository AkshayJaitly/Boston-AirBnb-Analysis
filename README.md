# Boston AirBnb Data Analysis
Analysing the Boston Data for Airbnb. The blog post is here https://medium.com/@aj455/boston-airbnb-data-analysis-43c38b1cfae5

## Motivation
This project was created as part of Udacity's Data Scientist nanodegree. Here I have analyzed Boston Airbnb Open Data following CRISP-DM methodology. Airbnb data for other cities have the same format. So the same understandings and code can be applied to Airbnb dataset of any other city.

The business questions which I have tried to answer in this project are as follows:
- Most common price listings for AirBnb?
- What is the relation between price and property type?
- Which room types in each neighbourhood have high prices?
- What are the top 5 amenities?

## Dataset Used:
Kaggle Boston AirBnb data https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston.
The following Airbnb activity is included in this Boston dataset:

- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## Libraries Used:
> 1. Numpy 
> 2. Pandas 
> 3. Matplotlib pyplot
> 4. Seaborn
> 5. Sklearn

## Language and Frameworks used:
Python3, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- The most common price listings are in the 50-200 USD range with the highest price being 4000 dollars
- Property types like bread and breakfast are the cheapest and room types which are shared are generally cheapest
- Entire homes/ apartments are the most costly in each neighbourhood while South boston Waterfront is the most expensive neighburhood at 306 dollars.
- Top 5 amenities are WirelessInternet, Heating, kitchen, Essentials, Smoke detector

## Deployment:
Using Google Collab, but can also be run using jupypter notebook command.
